Our Java application is a client-server game for the popular Dominican
card game 3&2 (Three and two). This is a single player or multi-player card game
that is played between four players taking turns.


//GAME MECHANICS--
////////////////////////

In this game four players are issued five random cards each.
The rest of the cards are put face down in a pile in the center of the table
(this is called the pick pile) then the card on top of this pile is place side
up next to it (this is called the discard pile).
Each player gets a turn where they can either take the card either on top of
the discard pile or on the pick pile and then discard one of the cards from the
six he now has in his hands and place it face up on the discard pile.
The objective of the game is to collect in your hands three cards of one rank
and two cards of another rank. (e.g: three 2’s and two Q’s). This is called
having 3&2.
The first player to have a 3&2 is the winner of the game.
   Players will take turns picking and discarding a card in a counter clock
side order, the first player being the one on the right side of the dealer.
